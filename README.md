YelpCamp allows users to review and browse through a variety of campgrounds and post their own. Users must be registered and logged in to post campgrounds and reviews but it's free for everyone to look through. The front end makes use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap, with Node.js, Express and MongoDB running in the back end. The website is deployed <a href="https://yelpcamp-rhaque.herokuapp.com" target="__blank">here</a> on heroku with its database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

<h1>Demo</h1>
<p>
  Users can demo the website with the following login details.
 
  <ul>
    <li>username: Michael</li>
    <li>password: password</li>
  </ul>
  
  A new account can also be created by visiting the register page. As a registered user that is logged in, you can create campgrounds and review existing camps. As the author of a camp or a review, you are able to edit and review as many times as you want and no one else is able to alter your content.
